The application is being developed using Python, for linting Python you can use pylint to check the code. For testing you can use pytest for unit tests, if the python application is a website developed with flask or fastapi you can use robot tests for E2E testing. The building step is not needed for python as it is an interpreted language and does not need to be built or compiled, but if the application was made with c++ you could use cmake for the build setup to compile the application. The CI alternatives other than github actions and Jenkins are for example Azure devops or Travis CI, these two seem like good options as well for setting up the CI, they both integrate well into github.The best option between cloud based and a self hosted environment, would probably be the cloud based solution for this project since it is quite small and only has 6 users working on it, there is also probably no specific hardware resources that would require a self hosted environment. If the project were to grow in the future in to a scenario where there are multiple teams working on it at the same time it might be wise to migrate to a self hosted CI environment to handle the extra load.
